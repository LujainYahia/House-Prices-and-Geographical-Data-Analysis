# House Prices and Geographical Data Analysis

## Overview:
This Python script performs data analysis and visualization tasks using two datasets: house prices and geographical data for New York City boroughs.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - geopandas
  - folium
  - mapclassify

## Installation:
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. Install the required Python libraries using pip:

```
pip3 install pandas matplotlib seaborn geopandas folium mapclassify
```

## Usage:
1. Place the 'HousePrices.csv' file in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
3. The script will perform the following tasks:
   - Read the house prices data from 'HousePrices.csv' into a pandas DataFrame.
   - Visualize the distribution of house prices using a boxplot.
   - Load New York City borough boundaries and visualize them using GeoPandas.
   - Calculate and visualize the area of each borough, including a legend.
4. Review the generated plots and analysis results.

## Files:
- `HousePrices.csv`: CSV file containing house prices data.
- `house_prices_analysis.py`: Python script for data analysis and visualization.

## Notes:
- Ensure that all required Python libraries are installed before running the script.
- The script assumes that the 'HousePrices.csv' file is structured appropriately with the necessary columns.
